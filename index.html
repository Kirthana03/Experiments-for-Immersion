                Designing for Immersion was a course facilitated by <a href= "https://wittywit.com/" style="color: rgb(123, 119, 150)">Pranshu</a> at University, it opened up multiple inquiries that I’m continuing to ponder upon.</h2>

            <h2>Strictly 2-dimensional media offers an object-like quality. You can choose to look away, move away or closer and so on. They're absolutely positioned in space or they're a fraction of an individual's field of view. If we move a step closer, 2-dimensional media could also be juxtaposed over our sight removing the absolute positioning in space as a character. They can also be placed 'around' on the internal faces of a cube 'surrounding' one's sight. When we move away from a cube to a sphere, we start to warp images. The notion of 2-dimensionality stands three primary challenges here. First, the image's composition, although is 2-D requires manipulation in the 3rd dimension. For images to be 'mapped' on to a non-planar surface, a referrant in 3-D space is required. A 3rd dimension's imagination helps make complete use of spatial affordances.  </h2>

                In 3-Dimensional space, primary extensions of activity involve looking and walking around. 
                If you look around yourself now, you might find corners and edges formed by walls or an open sky where trees and buildings slowly diminish in scale.

            <h2>Effectively communicating stories rely on a multitude of factors. For an individual to remain engaged in a story, the plot must offer something comprehensive in terms of language and rationality. If a story is functioning in suspended belief, the premise must be well established and the suspension must be systematically facilitated. We shall revisit ‘suspension of belief’ at a later stage.

            <h2>                Imagine entering the 3-D space of a software like blender or quite literally stepping into the television like Mike from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
                
                In this case storytelling can be approached through the lenses of phenomenology wherein the observer is participating in the story as much as any other element. </h2>

                <h2>A key difference between a photograph and a 3-D environment is that in the former, a story is told and in the latter a story is being told, as you experience it. My initial attempts at telling a story in this medium leveraged the 'presentness' offered by 3-D space.

            <h2>Another school of thought I like to borrow from while 'designing' experiences in general is performance arts. <br> How does the nature of staging shape meanings of the elements being staged? <br> The act of staging is an extension of expression that is planned and performed. There are various principles, guidelines and rules of thumb concerned with different forms of performance arts. If we treat the experience in 3-D space as a performance, how do we then arrange and time the elements to convey the narrative?

        <h1 id="sub">What could a blog ‘feel’ like in a spatial medium?</h1>

        <h2>Blogs are extensions of one’s experience expressed in words and etched in time on the internet. These expressions often are a means of communicating with the world, letting go of an idea and so forth. The relationship one shares with the practice of blogging is forged by a sense of yearning and liveliness. Their positioning in a ‘present’ social context and ‘personal’ nature 'layered' with complete visual and auditory engagement could lead to new forms of meaning-making and perceptions associated with blogs. 
        </h2>

        <h2>I chose to convey a short blog which formed the crux of the first idea for this experiment.

        <h2>This experiment took a rather craft-like approach, deconstructing complexities as they unfolded in all directions. Perhaps, this method of 'technique-narrative coupling' or 'affordance-association coupling' is something I'd like to ponder upon and tinker with to its boundaries in projects lying ahead. As for the call to wonder, regarding 'spatial blogs' themselves, I continue to think about qualities of written text, language and how we interact with them as foundations of spawning ideas. Notions of shared blog spaces and associative contexts provide more opportunities to push contemplation.
